# pihole-blocklist ðŸŽ®
Blocks online games that you might not want available to all. 

Works with [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). 

Use the Raw URL from [games_blocklist.txt](https://github.com/philip-holland/pihole-blocklist/blob/main/games_blocklist.txt) and then add it to your _AdLists_. Then go to _Tools_, and _Update Gravity_ to update all of your adlists, including this one.

__Hint__: Adlists can be selectively applied to groups of clients, so defining these by IP or MAC address can reduce the audience.
